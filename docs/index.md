# Hashi Learning

Let's get our learning on with all things Hashicorp (and a little more).

## Background

Some of us like to get things up and running extremely quick and not have to
worry about the mundane tasks involved. This repo will do exactly that. By
leveraging Vagrant and Ansible to do all of the heavy lifting.

The functionality of this repo will grow over time iteratively. So, keep an eye
out for new functionality over time.
